## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JS
- JS Local Storage
- SPA approach
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - Bootstrap library
- [Sortable](https://sortablejs.github.io/Sortable/) - Sortable JS library 

### What I learned

Making this project I've got better understinding of handling:

- Local Storage to save the changes users may do.
- The Sortable library to implement drag and drop to reorder items within a list.

### Continued development

In the future I'd like to add more functionalities to this project like:

- List groups or categories
- Deadlines for each item
- Push Notifications
- Flags or priorities

### Useful resources

- [Sortable](https://sortablejs.github.io/Sortable/) - I really liked working with this library which helped me with ordering items and drag and drop functionality a easy way and this even works on smartphone with touch events.
